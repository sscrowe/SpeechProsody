"Create recording directories" "Daniel Hirst" 20080706 0
<intro> "This function creates recording directories for each sound file in a specified subdirectory of the ##working directory# (as defined by the function @@Set working directory@)."
<normal> "The result is one recording directory for each sound file, with the same name as the sound minus the extension."
<normal> "This function is not necessary if your sound files are already organised in recording directories"
<normal> "The default parameters of the plugin specify a working directory called %test, which contains one subdirectory called %test1. This contains three sound files: %%English.wav%, %%French.wav% and %%Korean.wav%."
<normal> "Running the function with its default values will create three ##recording directories# called %English, %French and %Korean inside the subdirectory %test1, each one containing the appropriate sound file."
